= User accesses Platform services

As a User, I want to be able to access the services of the system within the context of my user profile.

. Admin logs in on the Platform
. Admin configures the access policy of the Platform services
. Guest successfully accesses unprotected services
. Guest is denied access to protected services
. Guest registers as a platform user with an exsiting (external) identity
. Unauthenticated Consumer/Expert is denied access to protected services
. Consumer/Expert logs in on the platform
. Consumer/Expert successfully accesses protected services
