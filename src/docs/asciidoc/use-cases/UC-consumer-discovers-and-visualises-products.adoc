= Consumer discovers and visualises products

As a Consumer I want to search for Products of all types by specification of textual and faceted search criteria. I want to be able to incrementally narrow my search with more criteria clauses. For each Product in the search result I want get more detailed information that describes the product, its usage terms and costs, and visualise the data graphically. Having discovered a product of interest I may 'save' it to my Workspace, download it, or use it as input to further exploitation activities.
