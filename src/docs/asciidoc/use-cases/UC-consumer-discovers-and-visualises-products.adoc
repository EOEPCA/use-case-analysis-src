= Consumer discovers and visualises products

As a Consumer I want to search for Products of all types by specification of textual and faceted search criteria. I want to be able to incrementally narrow my search with more criteria clauses. For each Product in the search result I want to get more detailed information that describes the product, its usage terms and costs, and visualise the data graphically. Having discovered a product of interest I may 'save' it to my Workspace, download it, or use it as input to further exploitation activities.

<<img_productDiscovery>> illustrates discovery of EO data products using the EO Browser system.

'''

. Consumer logs in on the EP
. Consumer begins searching for products on the EP. The starting point is the full unfiltered product set that contains commercial/non-commercial EO data and value-added products
. Optionally, the resultset is automatically filtered to include only those collections that the Consumer has right to visualise. _It may be the case that the EP chooses to make these 'unavailable collections' visible to the Consumer to publicise their existence_
. Consumer filters the resultset by any combination of textual search terms, area of interest, time of interest, selection of collection(s) and selection of product facets
. Consumer incrementally adjusts their search criteria to refine the filtered resultset
. Consumer selects a product of interest; the EP checks they are authorised to access the product
. Consumer views detailed metadata for the selected product
. Consumer views T&Cs for the service and accepts terms of not already done so
. Optionally, the Consumer 'saves' (a reference to) the product to their workspace
. Consumer requests the cost for access/usage of the data
. Optionally, the Consumer visualises the product with a graphical representation. _The Consumer is able to parameterise the visualisation interactively, e.g. specification of layers to view etc._
. Optionally, the Consumer downloads the visualisation results

NOTE: The use case does not mention the Guest user. It should be taken into account that an EP may choose to allow limited access to a Guest user, such as searching/browsing catalogues, before insisting on user login for exploitation activities. _This approach might be typical in order to allow a potential user discover EP capabilities before signing up_

NOTE: The use case does not consider the case where the Consumer is able to select sub-setting (spatial/temporal) of the data product itself, which might be typical of data accessible through a service such as OPeNDAP. _The extent to which this case should be considered for the EP is TBD_
