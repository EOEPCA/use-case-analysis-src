| Platform Function | UM | P&C | RM

| Platform contains a searchable catalogue of interactive applications searchable using free text and facets | | | x
| Platform can perform federated search of interactive applications, also using free text and facets | | | x
| EP provides a browser-based UI for performing interactive application searches and viewing results | | | x
| Catalogue can filter or mark results based on user account data (eg, licences purchased, commercial vs academic user) and interactive application access rules / ownership | x | | x
| Catalogue can refuse access to some or all interactive application information based on the user and resource (eg, show summary or search result but not detailed manual) | x | | x
| Catalogue contains and EP can display, for each application, detailed metadata, documentation, required T&Cs and costing data (licence costs, data to estimate data sizes/processing times, special requirements (eg GPUs)) | | | x
| EP can store and return text and metadata for application T&Cs | | | x
| EP permits authorized users to add and update T&C text and metadata | | | x
| EP permits authorized users to update application access rules and settings (licences required, descriptions, costing data, etc) | | | x
| EP can request, record and display acceptance of identified T&Cs by a user (or organisation?) | x | |
| EP can prevent access to applications and metadata when T&C acceptance is required and not completed and can prompt the user to do this | x | x | x
| EP can stop applications if quotas, budgets or credit-control constraints are reached | | x |
| EP can prevent applications from accessing input data when data T&C acceptance is required and not completed and can prompt the user to do this | x | x | x
| EP provides a 'user workspace' and can record identifiers of 'saved' applications and settings chosen | | | x
| Consumer can use a data search to find compatible input data for an interactive application, if required by the application | | | x
| Consumer can use their workspace saved data to specify data for an interactive application | | | x
| An interactive application can request data and/or processing as required by its functionality | | x |
| EP can cost interactive application use (which may involve estimating data size, processing time and licencing costs) | | x | x
| Consumer can use an interactive application in a web browser | | x |
| Consumer can save screenshots and other outputs from an application to the workspace | | x | x
| Consumer can download screenshots and other outputs from an application | | x |
| User's billing account is updated as the application is used | | x |
| Consumer can publish application output data to the catalogue, after entering all required metadata that isn't supplied by the application or its output file | | x | x
| Consumer can specify licences and access restrictions for the published application outputs (which will apply in addition to restrictions on required input data) | | | x
| Consumer can resume an earlier interactive application 'session' by choosing it from a list | | x | x
| EP includes interactive applications in the site map for search engines | | | x

TODO: Make explicit that interactive applications are intended to be like processing services - ie, containerized stuff - and can be console applications, web applications or remote desktop applications (ie, things that open a port you talk to and which may have a URL that can be embedded in the UI).
